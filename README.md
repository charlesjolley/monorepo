# Monorepo Starter

Setup the way Charles likes it. Steps to configure:

1. Global find/replace '@package-name' with package prefix
2. Clone packages/examples as a good starting point
   - When creating local dependencies, edit package.json & tsconfig references

## TODO

Create examples that don't nest code in `src`, since it just adds extra
complexity.
